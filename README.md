# DXIL-SPIRV

This fork of the project is primarily aimed at improving the experience and reverse engineering of DXBC shaders.

It is assumed that the resulting spirv files are likely not Vulkan-ready, but rather can be decompiled into any shader language of your choice (though the emphasis will be more on HLSL).

# Original description

This project aims to provide translation of DXIL (SM 6.x) shaders to SPIR-V which can be used in the vkd3d project,
which implements D3D12 on top of Vulkan.
Using [dxbc-spirv](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxbc-spirv) it also handles legacy DXBC shaders.

## Building

### Dependencies

Check out submodules first with `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
No external dependencies apart from the submodules are required to build.

This project implements a "small" LLVM C++ API subset which acts as a drop-in replacement for the full LLVM.
It is possible to build against the true LLVM C++ API if llvm is checked out in `external/llvm` and `-DDXIL_SPIRV_NATIVE_LLVM=ON` CMake option is used.
See `checkout_llvm.sh` script.

### Build

Standard CMake build.

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Linking against dxil-spirv

Only the C API is installed and is expected to be kept ABI/API stable when it releases.

### pkg-config

```shell
pkg-config dxil-spirv-c-shared --cflags --libs
```

### CMake module

Something like:

```
find_package(dxil_spirv_c_shared)
if (dxil_spirv_c_shared_FOUND)
	message("Found dxil-spirv! Enabling DXIL support.")
	target_link_libraries(vkd3d-shader PRIVATE dxil-spirv-c-shared)
	target_compile_definitions(vkd3d-shader PRIVATE HAVE_DXIL_SPV)
	target_sources(vkd3d-shader PRIVATE vkd3d/libs/vkd3d-shader/dxil.c)
else()
	message("Did not find dxil-spirv :( Disabling DXIL support.")
endif()
```

## Testing

The primary method of testing dxil-spirv and avoiding regressions is through a reference shader suite.

### Build DXC

First, build DXC. To keep output consistent, we must use a fixed version of DXC.
Currently, this only works on Linux, the Windows build of DXC does not seem to support CMake properly.

```shell
./checkout_dxc.sh
./build_dxc.sh
```

The test suite accepts an arbitrary path to DXC, so if you have a standalone binary somewhere, that can work as well.

### Run test suite

When adding new tests, place the HLSL test in `shaders/` somewhere and run:

```shell
./test_shaders.py shaders --dxc external/dxc-build/bin/dxc --dxil-spirv cmake-build-debug/dxil-spirv
```

If there is any mismatch, the test script will complain. If there are legitimate changes to be made,
add `--update` to the command. The updated files should now be committed alongside the dxil-spirv change.
`--parallel` can (and should) be used to speed up the process.

To update DXBC references, run:

```shell
./cmake-build-debug/dxbc-spirv-sandbox ./reference-dxbc
```

### Running large repro suites

For internal development, we also have an extensive repro suite which cover real-world content.
These cannot be made public for obvious reasons, so the intent is that symlinks are set up during development.
Shaders can be dumped with `VKD3D_SHADER_DUMP_PATH`.

```shell
# The scripts might not work properly if the paths aren't laid out like this.
ln -s ${DXIL_SPIRV_REPO}/shaders shaders-dxil
ln -s ${DXBC_SPIRV_REPO}/shaders shaders-dxbc
ln -s ${DXIL_SPIRV_REPO}/reference/shaders reference/shaders-dxil
ln -s ${DXBC_SPIRV_REPO}/reference/shaders reference/shaders-dxbc

./test_shaders.py shaders-dxil --dxil-spirv cmake-build-release/dxil-spirv --parallel --update
./test_shaders.py shaders-dxbc --dxil-spirv cmake-build-release/dxil-spirv --parallel --update
```

To import shaders into the suite:

```shell
mkdir shaders-dxil/dxilgame
mkdir shaders-dxbc/dxbcgame
# For DXIL
./copy_reference_shaders.py --dxil /tmp/path/to/vkd3d-shader-dump-path --raw --output shaders-dxil/dxilgame
# For DXBC
./copy_reference_shaders.py --dxbc /tmp/path/to/vkd3d-shader-dump-path --raw --output shaders-dxbc/dxbcgame
```

To run an isolated subfolder only, there's `--subfolder`.
